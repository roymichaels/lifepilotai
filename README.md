## Setup Instructions

### 1. Stripe Configuration

Create the following products and prices in your Stripe dashboard:

#### Products
1. **Personal Plan**
   - Monthly Price ID: `price_personal_monthly`
   - Yearly Price ID: `price_personal_yearly`

2. **Pro Plan**
   - Monthly Price ID: `price_pro_monthly`
   - Yearly Price ID: `price_pro_yearly`

3. **Add-ons**
   - Extra Messages: `price_addon_messages`
   - Team Seat: `price_addon_seat`

### 2. Environment Variables

Copy the provided `.env.example` file to `.env` in the project root and fill in the values.
Frontend variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` so Vite can expose them to the client. The
Firebase values are required for authentication to work correctly.


#### Frontend
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` – base URL of the remote API
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` – OpenAI key used by the browser (optional)
- `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` – ElevenLabs key for voice features (optional)
- `VITE_ELECTRIC_URL` – URL of the ElectricSQL backend (optional)
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` – Firebase project API key
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` – Firebase auth domain
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` – Firebase project ID
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` – Firebase storage bucket URL
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` – Firebase messaging sender ID
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` – Firebase app ID

### 3. Firebase Console Setup
1. Open the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and navigate to **Authentication → Sign‑in method**.
   Enable **Email/Password** or any other providers your app uses.
2. Under **Authentication → Settings**, add your development and production
   domains to the **Authorized domains** list (include `localhost` for local testing).
3. Copy the Firebase project credentials into your `.env` file using the variable
   names shown above.

### 4. Running the App
Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn`). Start the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This command starts the Vite dev server.

## Brain prompt configuration

The prompts and behaviour used by Aura are defined under `src/brain/`.  Each
file represents a layer of the AI:

- `cognition.ts` – base system prompt and context
- `behavior.ts` – communication style
- `filters.ts` – message filters applied before sending
- `skills.ts` – available helper skills

These are combined in `Brain.ts` and imported by the chat API.  To tweak Aura's
responses, edit the objects in these files.  No other code changes are needed as
all chat functions read the configuration from `Brain.ts`.
